# Session Context (2025-08-15)

## Current Session Focus: Container Execution Integration

**Priority Order** (per human directive):
1. **Container-based restore execution** (build on existing foundation)
2. **Container-based backup execution** (critical gap - never tested before)  
3. Progress parsing and dashboard status (lower priority)

## Key Context to Preserve

**Critical Gap Identified**: 
- ‚úÖ Restore operations use container execution (`restic/restic:0.18.0`)
- ‚ùå Backup execution still uses local restic binary (inconsistent strategy)

**Test Environment Setup**: Human will provide test restic repo + test rsync repo (not live yeti data)

**Current Jobs in Config**:
- `retro`: SSH‚Üírsyncd (yeti to nuc)
- `test-notifications`: local‚Üílocal  
- `yeti`: SSH‚ÜíRestic REST (yeti.home.arpa with container_runtime: docker)

## ResticRunner Analysis Status - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ ResticRunner already has plan_backup_job() and plan_restore_job() methods
- ‚úÖ Container execution is implemented in ResticCommand._build_container_command()
- ‚úÖ RestoreHandler is already using ResticRunner correctly
- ‚ùå **PROBLEM FOUND**: ResticCommandBuilder._build_chained_commands() manually builds local restic commands instead of using container execution
- ‚ùå **PROBLEM FOUND**: Backup execution path doesn't use container execution for SSH sources

## Current Architecture Analysis
**BackupExecutor** ‚Üí **CommandBuilderFactory** ‚Üí **ResticCommandBuilder** ‚Üí **ResticRunner**
- ResticCommandBuilder calls ResticRunner.plan_backup_job() ‚úÖ
- Single commands use primary_command.to_ssh_command() (container execution) ‚úÖ  
- Chained commands (init + backup) manually build local restic commands ‚ùå
- Need to fix _build_chained_commands() to use container execution

## Container Execution Strategy
- Use official `restic/restic:0.18.0` containers on remote hosts
- SSH validation populates `container_runtime` field (docker/podman)
- Container execution solves version mismatch problems
- Secret obfuscation implemented (passwords hidden in logs)

## Files Needing Updates (from SUBSYSTEMS.md)
- `services/restic_runner.py`: Examine existing methods, update as needed
- `handlers/restore_handler.py`: Replace manual command building with ResticRunner calls
- Backup execution pipeline: Integrate ResticRunner container patterns

## Container Execution Integration - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
‚úÖ **FIXED**: ResticCommandBuilder._build_chained_commands() now uses container execution
- Replaced manual local restic command building with ResticCommand._build_container_command() 
- Each chained command (init, backup, forget, prune) now uses official restic/restic:0.18.0 container
- Commands are chained with && for sequential execution on remote host

‚úÖ **FIXED**: ResticRunner.plan_backup_job() now passes job_config to all ResticCommand instances
- Added job_config parameter to init_cmd, backup_cmd, forget_cmd, prune_cmd
- Enables container runtime detection (docker/podman) from SSH validation results

‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: Restic repository initialization with container execution
- Added ResticHandler.init_repository() method with 10-second timeout
- Added /restic-init endpoints (GET and POST) in app.py
- Enhanced response formatting with repository_id parsing and structured error types
- Successfully tested: SSH to vegas.home.arpa ‚Üí docker run restic/restic:0.18.0 init
- Repository created at rest:http://yeti.home.arpa:8000/highball/ with ID 633ea0b609

## Implementation Status Summary
- ‚úÖ Container-based restore execution (already working)
- ‚úÖ Container-based backup execution (fixed in this session)  
- ‚ùå Real progress parsing (pending - lower priority)
- ‚ùå Dashboard status integration (pending - lower priority)

## Session Decisions Made
- SESSION.md created for context preservation across /compress cycles
- Focus on restore first, then backup execution - COMPLETED
- Test environment will be provided by human (separate from live yeti data)
- Container execution integration achieved through ResticRunner fixes

## Container Backup Execution - SUCCESS ‚úÖ  
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Container-based dry-run backup completed successfully!
- ‚úÖ **WORKING**: SSH to vegas.home.arpa ‚Üí docker run restic/restic:0.18.0 ‚Üí REST server
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: Container path mapping working (`/backup-source-0/` mount point)
- ‚úÖ **PROCESSED**: 29 files from `/home/ja2ui0/src/ja2ui0/highball/tests` successfully backed up

## Legacy Path Elimination - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Fixed Files**:
- `handlers/restic_command_builder.py`: _build_source_display() now requires source_paths array
- `services/restic_runner.py`: _parse_source_paths() now enforces source_paths array format  
- `handlers/restic_handler.py`: _parse_source_from_form() now creates source_paths array
- `services/restic_content_analyzer.py`: _get_source_sample_files() now uses source_paths array

## Critical Notes for Future Development
1. **Form Encoding**: Review remaining URL-encoded forms for multipart security preference
2. **Method Naming**: `_execute_rsync` method is provider-agnostic but name suggests rsync-only - needs renaming
3. **Resource Usage**: Need to nice/ionice restic processes to prevent CPU overheating during backups
4. **Runaway Processes**: Fixed issue where stuck backup jobs created high-CPU restic processes

## Container Execution Integration - COMPLETE SUCCESS ‚úÖ

### Summary of Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Container-Based Backup Execution**: Successfully implemented SSH ‚Üí container execution for Restic backups
- ‚úÖ **Local UI Operations**: Fixed snapshot listing to use local restic binary (no container overhead for UI)  
- ‚úÖ **Repository Management**: Restic init, backup, restore, and browsing all working with proper execution strategy
- ‚úÖ **Legacy Path Elimination**: All code now enforces `source_paths` array format 
- ‚úÖ **End-to-End Testing**: Dry-run and real backup both completed successfully with return code 0

### Verified Working Operations
- **Container Execution**: `ssh vegas.home.arpa docker run restic/restic:0.18.0` for backup operations ‚úÖ
- **Local Execution**: `restic -r rest:http://yeti.home.arpa:8000/highball snapshots` for UI operations ‚úÖ
- **Repository Creation**: Successfully created repository with ID `633ea0b609` ‚úÖ
- **Backup Completion**: 29 files backed up with snapshot ID `bc06a15c` ‚úÖ  
- **Snapshot Listing**: UI can list snapshots without SSH/container overhead ‚úÖ

### Design Point Implemented
- **UI/Local operations**: Use local restic binary inside Highball container (efficient, no overhead)
- **Remote SSH operations**: Use container execution for version consistency and reliability
- **REST Repository Access**: Direct HTTP access from Highball container to yeti REST server

## Session Completion - Password Obfuscation Fixed ‚úÖ

### Final Achievement (2025-08-15 Session End)
‚úÖ **FIXED**: Command logging truncation and API response password exposure
- **Issue**: Restore commands were being truncated in logs at password field, and API responses exposed real passwords
- **Root Cause**: Complex regex quote-handling logic was failing on container command strings like `"docker run --rm -e 'RESTIC_PASSWORD=9EeZVWm5kLFrF!' ..."`
- **Solution**: Simplified to direct string replacement using actual job password from `dest_config` instead of form data
- **Result**: Both logs and API responses now properly show `'RESTIC_PASSWORD=***'` with complete command display

### Key Technical Insights
1. **Human Guidance**: "Step back from regex hell and use simple approach" - using actual password value for direct replacement
2. **Password Source**: Form password (`test123`) ‚â† Job password (`9EeZVWm5kLFrF!`) - need job's `dest_config.password`
3. **Quote Escaping**: Container commands use shell quoting that breaks complex regex patterns - simple string replacement avoids this entirely

## CRITICAL GAPS REMAINING ‚ö†Ô∏è

### High Priority (Functional Issues)
1. **Resource Management**: Restic processes cause CPU overheating - need nice/ionice implementation
2. **Method Naming Confusion**: `_execute_rsync` method handles all providers but name suggests rsync-only (misleading for maintenance)
3. **Form Security Review**: Some endpoints may still use URL-encoded forms instead of multipart (security concern)

### Medium Priority (UI/UX Issues)  
4. **Restic Init UI**: No user interface for repository initialization workflow (users can't create repos via UI)
5. **Restore Progress**: Uses simulated progress instead of real `restic restore --json` parsing
6. **Dashboard Status**: Restore operations don't show "Restoring... N%" status in main dashboard

### Low Priority (Enhancement)
7. **Progress Parsing**: General backup progress could be more accurate with real JSON parsing
8. **Error Handling**: Some validation paths may need improvement after path refactoring

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. **üî• URGENT**: Implement nice/ionice to prevent CPU overheating during backup operations
2. **üîß MAINTENANCE**: Rename `_execute_rsync` to `_execute_backup` or similar provider-agnostic name
3. **üîê SECURITY**: Audit remaining URL-encoded form usage and migrate to multipart
4. **üí° FEATURE**: Design UI workflow for restic repository initialization

## Session Summary for /compress
**MAJOR SUCCESS**: Complete container execution integration achieved with all critical security fixes. Container-based backup/restore execution working end-to-end. Legacy path elimination complete. Password obfuscation working properly in logs and API responses. Test repository functional.

**READY FOR**: Fix snapshot introspection bug, then resource optimization (nice/ionice), method renaming, UI enhancements, progress improvements.

## Implementation Notes for Context Recovery
**Snapshot-driven restore code added to `services/restic_runner.py`:**
- `_extract_snapshot_id_from_args()` - extracts snapshot ID from restore command args
- `_get_snapshot_root_paths()` - calls `restic ls <snapshot_id>` to get paths, extracts root dirs like `/backup-source-0` or `/home`  
- Modified container mounting logic in `_build_container_command()` for restore operations
- Uses `BackupClient.execute_via_ssh()` or `BackupClient.execute_locally()` for snapshot introspection

**Test snapshots in repository:**
- `bc06a15c`: Old snapshot with `/backup-source-0` paths (should fail to mount)
- `64a91352`: New snapshot with `/home/ja2ui0/src/ja2ui0/highball/tests` paths (should succeed)

**Debug approach:** Check if introspection is returning empty list by adding logging or testing the `restic ls` command manually.

## Session Achievements Summary (2025-08-15)
‚úÖ Container-based backup execution implemented and tested
‚úÖ Container-based restore execution verified working  
‚úÖ Legacy single path support completely eliminated
‚úÖ Overwrite detection fixed with proper path mapping
‚úÖ Command logging truncation resolved
‚úÖ API response password exposure fixed
‚úÖ User permission enforcement implemented with --user flag to prevent root filesystem access
‚úÖ Real path implementation completed - new backups use actual source paths in repository
‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained - old snapshots with /backup-source-{i} paths still accessible
‚úÖ End-to-end test_restic backup/restore workflow operational

## ACTIVE BUG: Snapshot-Driven Restore Implementation In Progress
‚ùå **Restore mount logic attempted but not working**
- **Problem**: Implemented snapshot introspection in `ResticRunner._get_snapshot_root_paths()` but volume mounts not appearing in docker commands
- **Current state**: Both old and new snapshot restores show no `-v` flags in docker command, using non-existent `/restore-target` path
- **Root cause**: Snapshot introspection happening during container building but failing silently, returning empty path list
- **Next step**: Debug why `_get_snapshot_root_paths()` returns empty list - likely permission/timing issue with restic ls command
- **Test commands**: 
  - Old snapshot `bc06a15c` should mount `/backup-source-0` and fail (path doesn't exist)
  - New snapshot `64a91352` should mount `/home/ja2ui0/src/ja2ui0/highball/tests` and succeed
- **Expected behavior**: `docker run -v /actual/path:/actual/path` based on snapshot contents, not job config
