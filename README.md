Highball is a lightweight, self-hosted backup frontend for managing backup jobs across multiple hosts.
- Connect over SSH or rsync daemons, validate endpoints, and schedule jobs from a single web interface.
- Start with rsync-based workflows, then grow into rclone and restic as you need them.

> One place to define, validate, and run backup policies for media libraries and stack persistent storage.
