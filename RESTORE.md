# Restore Functionality Implementation Plan

## Core Architecture

**Dashboard-centric workflow**: Restore initiated from dashboard "Inspect" buttons â†’ `/inspect?name=<jobname>` â†’ integrated restore interface
**MVP Provider**: Restic-only initially, architecture designed for multi-provider expansion  
**Restore Location**: `/restore` directory in container (ephemeral for development, bind-mount ready for production)

## User Workflow

1. **Dashboard** â†’ Click "Inspect" button for any job
2. **Inspect Page** (`/inspect?name=<jobname>`) contains:
   - Job logs (moved from current `/logs` page)
   - Backup browser with restore controls
   - Restore status/progress display
3. **Restore Selection**:
   - Browse snapshots (latest first) 
   - Use existing checkbox system for granular file/folder selection
   - "Select All" button for full snapshot restore (Restic native)
4. **Restore Target**: Start with "Restore to Highball" (MVP), expand to source/download later
5. **Security**: Modal password confirmation for restore operations

## Dashboard Integration  

**Job Status Changes**:
- `Enabled` â†’ `Paused` during restore operations
- Status shows `Restoring... N%` with progress from `restic restore --json`
- Dashboard buttons adapt: `RUN`â†’`KILL`, `DRY RUN`â†’`FOLLOW`, `EDIT` hidden during restore

## Technical Implementation

**New Components**:
- `/handlers/restore_handler.py` - RestoreHandler following BackupHandler pattern
- `/services/restore_service.py` - Background restore execution with progress parsing
- `/templates/job_inspect.html` - New inspect page template
- Route: `GET /inspect?name=<jobname>` (replaces current `/logs` functionality)

**Existing Code Reuse**:
- Backup browser tree structure and checkbox system (no changes needed)
- Job logger system (extend for restore tracking)
- Background job execution patterns
- Modal UI patterns from job forms

**Progress Monitoring**:
- Parse `restic restore --json` output for file counts and progress
- Update job status with restore progress percentage  
- Real-time progress display on dashboard

## Implementation Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… Created `/inspect?name=<jobname>` endpoint and InspectHandler
2. âœ… Moved job logs to per-job inspect pages, `/logs` â†’ `/dev`
3. âœ… Extended backup browser with restore controls and "Select All" toggle
4. âœ… Implemented restore UI with "Restore to Highball" target and dry run (default on)
5. âœ… Dashboard "History" â†’ "Inspect" buttons, preserved job status information
6. âœ… Separated system debugging to `/dev` with network scanner

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Restore Execution (NEXT)
1. Create RestoreHandler for processing restore requests
2. Implement Restic restore command building and execution
3. Background restore execution with `restic restore --json` progress parsing
4. Dashboard status integration with "Restoring... N%" progress display
5. Modal password confirmation for restore operations
6. Job status changes: `Enabled` â†’ `Paused` during restore

### Phase 3: Polish & Expand (FUTURE)
1. Restore to source target
2. Single file download capability
3. Multi-provider architecture (rsync, etc.)
4. Advanced features (include/exclude patterns, progress notifications)

## File Structure Changes

**âœ… Completed Routes**:
- âœ… `GET /inspect?name=<jobname>` â†’ Job inspection hub (InspectHandler)
- âœ… `GET /dev` â†’ System debugging (LogsHandler.show_dev_logs)
- âœ… Dashboard "History" â†’ "Inspect" buttons (always available)

**ðŸš§ Next Routes**:
- `POST /restore` â†’ Execute restore operation (RestoreHandler)
- Dashboard job status integration for restore progress

**âœ… Completed Files**:
- âœ… `/handlers/inspect_handler.py` â†’ Per-job inspection
- âœ… `/templates/job_inspect.html` â†’ Integrated job status, backup browser, restore controls, logs
- âœ… `/templates/dev_logs.html` â†’ System debugging with network scanner
- âœ… Updated `/handlers/job_display.py` â†’ Inspect links
- âœ… Updated `/app.py` â†’ Routing for new endpoints

## Technical Notes

**Restic Integration**:
- Use `restic restore --json` for progress monitoring
- Support both full snapshot restore and granular file selection
- Password required for restore operations (security confirmation)

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Follow existing BackupHandler/BackupExecutor separation of concerns
- Reuse job conflict detection system
- Extend job logger for restore operation tracking  
- Modal password pattern from existing job forms
