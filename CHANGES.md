# Changes 2025-08-18 - Critical Systems Recovery & Jinja2 Migration

## Current State: CORE FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED
**Status**: Application functional with critical backup execution and UI form systems working. Jinja2 migration completed.

**Key Achievements**: Fixed fundamental SSH backup execution bug, completed full Jinja2 template migration, restored progressive form disclosure.

## Architectural State Transition

### ✅ COMPLETED: Consolidation Recovery 
**Problem Solved**: Application was completely broken after previous consolidation work
- **JobFormDataBuilder**: Added missing methods (`build_empty_form_data()`, etc.)
- **Template Variables**: Fixed literal `{{CONFIG_WARNING}}`, `{{JOB_ROWS}}` displaying as text
- **CSS Compliance**: Removed inline CSS, used existing classes from `/static/style.css`
- **Display String Pattern**: Established Handler → Template Service → Partials pattern (no HTML in handlers)

### ✅ COMPLETED: SSH Execution Recovery for Backup Browser
**Problem**: Backup browser couldn't list snapshots despite repositories containing data
**Solution**: Added SSH execution support to `ResticRepositoryService.list_snapshots_with_ssh()`
**Pattern**: `ssh user@host docker run restic/restic:0.18.0 -r repo snapshots --json`
**Results**: API returns actual snapshots, backup browser loads correctly

### ✅ COMPLETED: Jinja2 Template Migration  
**Status**: COMPLETE - All templates migrated from legacy `{{VARIABLE}}` to Jinja2 syntax
**Achievement**: 100% template consistency, removed legacy template support entirely
**Migration Pattern**: `{{VARIABLE}}` → `{{ variable }}`, `{{INCLUDE:file}}` → `{% include 'partials/file' %}`, `{{VAR_CHECKED}}` → `{% if var_checked %}checked{% endif %}`
**Critical Changes**:
- All templates in `templates/pages/` and `templates/partials/` converted
- `services/template.py`: Removed legacy `_process_includes()` method 
- Jinja2 environment with autoescape, conditionals, includes
- Template system now enforces modern syntax, errors on legacy patterns

### ✅ COMPLETED: Enhanced SSH Validation System
**Problem**: SSH validation was showing identical, inadequate results for both source and destination validation
**Root Cause**: 
- Template service was generating HTML strings instead of using Jinja2 templates (architectural violation)
- Source and destination validation used same generic method instead of specialized validation
- Binary version information was missing from source validation
- Path validation errors didn't show SSH connection success details
**Solution**:
- **Source Validation**: Enhanced to show SSH connection + rsync version + container engine (podman > docker > not found)
- **Destination Validation**: Specialized to show SSH connection + path accessibility + backup/restore capability guidance
- **Architectural Fix**: Moved HTML generation from services to proper Jinja2 template (`partials/validation_result.html`)
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced to show SSH success details even when path validation fails
- **Display Order**: SSH connection always appears first in validation results
**Result**: 
- Source validation shows practical binary availability for backup operations
- Destination validation shows path permissions with "backup only" vs "backup + restore" guidance
- Proper architectural separation maintained (services → templates → HTML)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Critical SSH Backup Execution Fix
**Problem**: Backup jobs failing with "does not exist, skipping" despite SSH connectivity working
**Root Cause**: `container_runtime` configured at job level instead of in `source_config` 
**Solution**: 
- Fixed configuration structure: moved `container_runtime` into `source_config` 
- Updated backup execution to use existing `ContainerService.build_backup_container_command()`
- Fixed duration formatting bug in operations handler
**Result**: SSH backup execution fully functional (dry-run tested: completed in 1.05s)

### ✅ COMPLETED: HTMX Form Progressive Disclosure Fix
**Problem**: Add job form source type selection not showing relevant fields
**Root Cause**: Missing `parse_qs` import + duplicate form parsing causing empty form data
**Solution**:
- Added missing `from urllib.parse import parse_qs` import
- Modified app.py to pass pre-parsed form data to HTMX handlers
- Fixed forms handler to accept pre-parsed data instead of re-parsing
**Result**: Progressive disclosure working - SSH/local source types show appropriate fields

### ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Restore Functionality 
**Status**: HTMX architecture implemented but UNTESTED
**Implementation**: 
- Restore overwrite checking uses existing `RestoreService` with proper business logic delegation
- HTMX handlers pass simple data to Jinja2 templates (no HTML generation in handlers)
- Templates use conditionals for warning display and confirmation requirements
**Needs Testing**: Complete restore workflow from backup browser through overwrite checking

## Critical Patterns Established

### ✅ Display String Pattern (WORKING)
**Pattern**: Handler builds display strings → Template service handles iteration → Partials render HTML
**Files**: `handlers/pages.py` (_build_source_display_with_type), `services/template.py` (_build_job_rows), `templates/partials/job_row.html`
**Results**: Dashboard shows rich source/dest info with proper styling

### ✅ SSH Execution Pattern (WORKING) 
**Pattern**: Consolidated architecture implements same SSH patterns as legacy working code
**Key**: `ResticRepositoryService.list_snapshots_with_ssh()` - adapts working patterns to consolidated services
**Reference**: Legacy working code at `/home/ja2ui0/src/ja2ui0/highball-main/` for patterns to adapt

## Session Summary: Major Recovery Success

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
1. **SSH Backup Execution** - Core business logic now functional
2. **Jinja2 Template System** - Complete migration, no legacy patterns remaining  
3. **UI Form Progressive Disclosure** - Add job form now works correctly
4. **Architecture Consistency** - Template patterns unified, command building uses existing services
5. **SSH Validation System** - Comprehensive validation with binary versions and proper error handling
6. **Architectural Compliance** - HTML generation moved from services to proper Jinja2 templates

## Application Status: CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING
**Working Features**:
- ✅ Dashboard with job status and rich display strings
- ✅ Backup browser with SSH snapshot listing
- ✅ SSH backup execution (dry-run tested and working)
- ✅ Job management and configuration forms
- ✅ HTMX progressive form disclosure
- ✅ Modern Jinja2 template system throughout
- ✅ Container runtime detection and validation
- ✅ Enhanced SSH validation with binary versions (rsync, docker/podman)
- ✅ Destination path validation with backup/restore capability detection
- ✅ Proper error handling showing SSH success even when path validation fails

**Critical Testing Needed** (Next Session):
- ⚠️ **Real backup execution** (not dry-run)
- ⚠️ **Restore operations** with overwrite protection
- ⚠️ **Notification system** (email/telegram)  
- ⚠️ **Restic maintenance operations** (discard/prune/check)
- ⚠️ **Rsync backup patterns** (multi-provider)

## Next Session Critical Tasks

**PRIORITY ORDER** (per CLAUDE.md requirements):
1. **Real Backup Execution Testing** - Test actual backup execution beyond dry-run
2. **Restore Operations Testing** - Verify HTMX restore workflow with overwrite protection
3. **Notification System Testing** - Test email/telegram notifications for job success/failure  
4. **Restic Maintenance Testing** - Test discard/prune/check operations and scheduling
5. **UI Functionality Polish** - Fix remaining form validation, workflow issues
6. **Rsync Pattern Testing** - Verify multi-provider backup support

**Framework Migration**: Only after all core functionality verified → FastAPI/Pydantic migration

## Legacy Reference
**Working Code**: `/home/ja2ui0/src/ja2ui0/highball-main/` - Use for patterns to adapt, NOT to copy files
**Key Insight**: Command builder factory patterns were critical for SSH execution - existing services in `binaries.py` contain the proven command building logic
